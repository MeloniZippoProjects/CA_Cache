# Percentage deviation from the minimum value 
# Ex: A deviation value of 10:1000:1000:1000:1000 will try to find an organization
# that compromises at most 10% delay. 
# NOTE: Try reasonable values for % deviation. Inconsistent deviation
# percentage values will not produce any valid organizations. For example,
# 0:0:100:100:100 will try to identify an organization that has both
# least delay and dynamic power. Since such an organization is not possible, CACTI will
# throw an error. Refer CACTI-6 Technical report for more details
